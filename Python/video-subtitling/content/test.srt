1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:01,879
As someone with an AI background,

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,277
I think you can probably explain to us,

3
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:06,916
you know, this whole hype of generative AI, right?

4
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:10,063
I mean, right now people want generative AI in everything.

5
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:11,363
What is this about? Right?

6
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:14,481
I mean, what is the potential that's been unlocked with

7
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,659
the GPT-3 and so on? Can you help us understand

8
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:20,657
from a lay person's perspective, right?

9
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,356
What this has done and what the future holds? Sure.

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,283
So I think if we just take a step back

11
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:29,402
and think about all the creative things as

12
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:32,309
humans do, you know, basically it's

13
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,347
like we collect from five senses that

14
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:38,386
we have and we output. That output could

15
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:42,064
be speech or written stuff

16
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:45,761
or art, etc. And just

17
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,969
think about generative AI the same thing,

18
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,708
which is an AI comes in the place of the human

19
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:55,246
and it generates what a human can generate,

20
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:58,484
which is speech or text

21
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,062
or images or videos, things

22
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:05,219
like that, etc. And what happened

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,437
and the biggest transformative thing that

24
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:09,997
happened in the last one, two,

25
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:13,174
two years, three years span is the

26
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,953
AI generation catching up with human levels.

27
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,951
I mean, if you take just three years back,

28
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:21,589
you would know what is AI written content.

29
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:23,827
You would know what is AI generated image.

30
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:28,084
Now the line between AI generated

31
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:31,563
and human creativity generated has blurred

32
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:35,181
and that has been blurred only in the last one year most

33
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:38,788
actively, whether these Stable diffusion, Dalle

34
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:42,267
models,  I mean, text to image models

35
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:46,134
or chat GPT, which responds

36
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,972
to almost like a human like conversation

37
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:54,249
and all these modalities, when I mean modalities,

38
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,634
text, image, speech and

39
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:59,829
the human sensory experience that we have!

40
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,684
Right now, AI is able to replicate one human sensory

41
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:06,823
experience, whether you are able to draw a nice illustration,

42
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,969
AI can do that. Whether you are able to

43
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:13,869
write a story, AI can do that. But think about

44
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:17,875
what real humans do! In the sense that

45
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,466
let us say if you write a story,

46
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:24,523
you can illustrate the story with specific

47
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:27,161
characters and even if you have 100 illustrations,

48
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:30,641
those characters and their attributes

49
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:34,086
flow through the 100 images that you

50
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,106
have throughout the story or book

51
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:40,173
and there is a coherence, there is a coherence between

52
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,832
text, images and

53
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,590
if you narrate that yourself with your voice,

54
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,138
there is a coherence on how you stress on important

55
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:51,457
characters, how you stress on other things.

56
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:55,295
So right now, AI is doing one task very well,

57
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:58,913
But let us think about generative AI

58
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:02,800
evolving into a multimodal generative AI,

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,208
those text and the illustrations that

60
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,286
accompany with them will be in coherence that is

61
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,466
there is continuity between images,

62
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:16,337
the same character is going to other place, etc things like that.

63
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:20,660
So what we can foresee in the future is multimodal AI,

64
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,547
doing more multimodal, multi-sensory generative AI

65
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:27,567
tasks that humans do.
